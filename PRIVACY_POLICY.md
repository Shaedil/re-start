# Privacy Policy for re-start

**Last Updated: December 20, 2025**

## Introduction

re-start ("we", "our", or "the extension") is a browser extension that replaces the browser new tab page. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

## Information We Collect

- **Task Data**: Tasks names, project/list names, and due dates you create within the extension
- **Settings and Preferences**: Your theme preferences, display settings, and configuration choices
- **API Credentials**: Authentication tokens for third-party services you choose to connect (Google Tasks, Todoist)
- **Location Data**: If you enable weather features, you may provide location information manually or allow access to your device's location

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information to:

- Display and manage your tasks
- Sync with third-party services (Google Tasks, Todoist) when you authorize such connections
- Provide weather information based on your location
- Save your preferences and settings

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: All data is primarily stored locally in your browser
- **Third-Party Services**: When you connect Google Tasks or Todoist, data is synced directly between your browser and those services using their official APIs
- **No Backend Servers**: We do not operate backend servers that collect or store your data

## Third-Party Services

This extension may integrate with:

- **Google Tasks**: For task synchronization (requires your authorization)
- **Todoist**: For task synchronization (requires your authorization)
- **Open-Meteo**: For weather information display (requires location data)

These services have their own privacy policies. When you use these integrations, their respective privacy policies apply to data shared with them.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties except:

- When you explicitly authorize connections to services like Google Tasks or Todoist
- As required by law

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Access your data stored by the extension
- Delete your data at any time by uninstalling the extension or clearing its storage
- Disconnect third-party service integrations at any time

## Children's Privacy
